Use UNION to combine the rowsets returned by mulitple queries.

Each unioned query must return the same number of columns with compatible data types.

By default, UNION eliminates duplicate rows. Specify the ALL option to include duplicates (or to avoid the overhead of checking for duplicates when you know in advance that there are none). 

Use INTERSECT to return only rows that are returned by both queries.

Use EXCEPT to return rows from the first query that are not returned by the second query.
